# A 3D model of a bust of Germanicus, British Museum

3D data for recreation of a British Museum object.
![](germanicus.gif)

This bust shows the Roman general Germanicus (15 BC - AD 19) in military dress. Germanicus was the nephew and adopted son of Tiberius (reigned AD 14-37), the second emperor of Rome. He commanded the eight Roman legions on the Rhine frontier, apparently with some distinction, recovering two of the legionary standards lost after a military disaster in the Teutoberg forest (AD 9).
